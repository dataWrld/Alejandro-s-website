        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Alejandro Reyes-Quinones, I'm 20 years old. Born April 10th 2003. <br>Here are some of my expirences and hobbies.
			Love to admire computer hardware. One of my hobbies is playing basketball.
			 By the end of the program, I hope to make 70k or more in my first I.T job offer.
			I've worked in a couple industries, and i enjoied the expirences. Here is my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-reyes-quinones-019659286">LinkedIn</a> profile to see the company's i've worked at.<br></p>

            <h1 >Journey</h1>
			<p>My first expirence with computers was with my mother old windows laptop. Her computer was so slow cause she downloaded so much bloatware and malware. <br>
			After that when my family had problems with their devices, I was the one too troubleshoot their tech. After a while i build a router to smoothen my gaming expirence.<br>
		    I downloaded the operating system from GitHub, but when i was looking at the code i didn't understand what i was looking at. It was fustrating, so was the other event problems that i coundn't solve in my computer endevors.<br>
		    Once i saved up money for parts to build my own computer, i had a friend of my help. Since he had expirence building his, but he wasn't really much help. It seems he had forgot eveything. Eventualy we powered it on and it worked. I looked up what programing languages should i start with , and many reconmended Python. So i now  know a little bit of Python. At the same time i learned about the lower levels of a computer like the bios, kernal, operating system, etc. Now i have a better understanding of the bash language also.<br><br></p>
            <p>After a while i was stuck. I didn't know how i was going to start my journey but when i heard Amazon pays for tution on software development, i was estatic. Before the program started, i kinda learned html before the program started. I would've of learned CSS but i don't really like designing. So i went ahead and started to learn JavaScript. Am really exited to get to JavaScript. It has been a journey that i would love to have a job in.</p>
